# Project goals

- The goal of this project was to learn how to incorporate testing into the development of a project using Jest. Getting into the habit of writing a test for a function before it has even been created felt odd at first, but I realised that the tests make you think about what result you want to see, so you can structure the function around how to get there. 

# Features

- Interactive browser-based game akin to the Hasbroâ„¢ board game, Battleship
